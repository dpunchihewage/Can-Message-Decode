The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas for reading Excel files, tabulate for formatting tables, datetime for generating timestamps, and openpyxl for writing Excel workbooks.

The function decode_data_field() is then defined. It prompts the user to input a PGN and data field in hexadecimal format. The input data field is cleaned up by removing any spaces, and then converted from hexadecimal to a binary string.

The function then retrieves the rows in the Excel file that correspond to the given PGN and extracts the relevant information for each SPN, including its number, parameter name, byte start, bit start, number of bits, and status values for different conditions.

Next, the function decodes each SPN using the binary data field and stores the decoded information, including the SPN number, parameter name, status, and binary representation, in a list. The decoded information is then printed as a table using the tabulate package.

Finally, a new Excel workbook is created with the decoded information written to it. The file name of the Excel workbook is based on the input PGN, data field, and current timestamp. The function then loops repeatedly using a while loop until the program is closed.

Overall, this code provides a useful tool for decoding PGNs and their data fields using information stored in an Excel file, and saves the decoded information to a new Excel workbook for later use.
