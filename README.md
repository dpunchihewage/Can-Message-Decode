This code defines a Python function called "decode_data_field()" that can decode a given PGN and its corresponding data field (in hexadecimal format) using information stored in an Excel file. The decoded information is then printed as a table and written to a new Excel workbook.

The function prompts the user to input the PGN and data field in hexadecimal format. It then removes any spaces from the data field string and converts it from hexadecimal to a binary string. The function retrieves the rows in the Excel file that correspond to the given PGN and extracts the SPN (Suspect Parameter Number), parameter name, byte start, bit start, number of bits, and status for each SPN.

The function then decodes each SPN using the binary data field, and stores the decoded SPNs, parameter names, statuses, and binary representations in a list. The decoded information is printed using the "tabulate" package as a table, and a new Excel workbook is created with the decoded SPNs written to it. The file name of the Excel workbook is created based on the input PGN, data field, and current timestamp.

Finally, the function is called repeatedly in a while loop until the program is closed
